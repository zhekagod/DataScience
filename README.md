Analysis of statistics data
Main program files of data analysis:
1) MatStatR1Z1 -> test3.py

   Based on a selection from a table file, it calculates the main mathematical statistical characteristics,
   first shows a bar chart with a curve of the approximating function, and then displays a graph of the empirical distribution function.
   
2) MatStatR2Z1 -> Hypothesis.py
   
   Based on a selection from a table file, it checks the null hypothesis, determines the critical area, constant,
   statistics of the selected verification criterion and the p-value.
   
3) MatStatR3Z1 -> MaxLlihoodEst.py
   
   Based on a selection from a table file, it determines the number of favorable outcomes for which the likelihood function is built,
   its values are calculated at specific significance levels and the value of the evaluation function is calculated.

   
5) MatStatR4Z1 -> Regression.py (executable file) + Statistics.py (my own library)

   Based on the selections from a table file, three main sample statistical characteristics are calculated, as well as the sample correlation,
   by which the linear regression equation is determined, a regression dependence graph is plotted and the forecast of one
   sample for another is calculated using the equation.
